      "\n",
      "Two people who are close friends or family members speak with short forms at the end of sentences, using them as a sign of intimacy. The use of long forms, in contrast, tends to imply the speaker’s intention to “keep a proper distance” from the listener. Short forms, then, are like talking on a first name basis, while long forms are like using “Mr.” and “Ms.”\n",
      "\n",
      "It may not be easy to decide when it is appropriate to switch to short forms. First of all, Japanese speakers are often very conscious of seniority. A year’s difference in age may in many cases totally preclude the possibility of establishing a truly “equal” relationship. Second, license to use short forms is not mutual; senior partners may feel perfectly justified in using short forms while expecting their junior partners to continue addressing them with long forms. Thus if somebody who is older, say, your Japanese language professor, talks to you using short forms, they would be greatly surprised if you should return the favor.\n",

      "What kind of music do you listen to?\n",
